Project Title: COVID Data Analysis using SQL in SSMS

Description: In this project, we explored and analyzed data related to COVID-19 cases. We utilized SQL in SSMS to perform various queries such as data exploration, format conversion, table join, aggregation functions, CTE creation, and temporary table creation.

Features:

- Data exploration of COVID-19 cases
- Format conversion of the data
- Joining tables to correlate data
- Aggregation functions to summarize data
- Creation of CTEs to simplify queries
- Creation of temporary tables for efficient data manipulation
- Technology Stack: SQL, SSMS

Outcome: This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 cases using SQL. It enables users to explore and analyze COVID-19 data in a structured manner, allowing for informed decision-making in combating the pandemic. The code is available on GitHub for reference and collaboration.
